## Test environments
* local Ubuntu 16.04 install, R 3.3.1
* local Windows 7 Professional 64-bit install, R 3.3.1
* win-builder (r-devel)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs. 

## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added single quotes to software names ('apa') and parentheses to function
  names (chisq.test()) in the DESCRIPTION file.

* Removed LICENSE file from submitted package, thus using the CRAN template for
  GPL-3.
